Code Style Guide
General Principles
Consistent Formatting: Use consistent indentation and spacing throughout the code to maintain readability. This project follows a 2-space indentation style.
Use Descriptive Variable Names: Variable names should clearly represent the data they hold. For example, score is better than s.
Keep Functions Short: Functions should ideally be no longer than 50 lines. Break them up into smaller, reusable functions when necessary.
Commenting: Comment your code when logic might not be immediately clear. Use comments to explain why something is done, not what is done (the code itself should explain the "what").
JavaScript Code Style
Variables and Constants:

Use const for values that do not change and let for values that may change.
Avoid using var.
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const maxTime = 120; // time in seconds
let score = 0;
Arrow Functions:

Use arrow functions for anonymous functions and callbacks where applicable.
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const increaseScore = () => {
score++;
};
Template Literals:

Use template literals for string concatenation when inserting variables into strings.
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
console.log(`Player's score is: ${score}`);
Naming Conventions:

Use camelCase for variable names and function names.
Use PascalCase for class names.
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
function handlePlayerInput() { ... }
const playerData = { name: 'John', score: 100 };
class GameManager { ... }
Event Listeners:

Use addEventListener to handle user events like clicks and keypresses.
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
document.getElementById('gameStartButton').addEventListener('click', startGame);
Avoid Global Variables:

Minimize the use of global variables. Encapsulate your logic in functions, classes, or modules.
Error Handling:

Always add error handling where necessary (e.g., try-catch blocks for asynchronous functions).
javascript
Copy
Edit
try {
// risky code
} catch (error) {
console.error('Error:', error);
}
